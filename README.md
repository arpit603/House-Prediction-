# House-Prediction- 
This Course Project is an application of Linear regression in real estate prediction.
 Steps - 
 1. importing the dataset and preprocessing ( removal of unnecessary columns)
 2. Splitting the dataset
 3. Training the regression model 
 4. computing mean squared error and r-squared value using program output and actual value
 5. Channging the Split ratio and calculating mean squared error and r-squared value in different cases
 6. Using Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression with various regularisation parameters.
